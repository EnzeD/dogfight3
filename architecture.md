# WW2 Dogfight Arena - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the modular architecture implemented for the WW2 Dogfight Arena game. The architecture follows a component-based design pattern, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined communication channels between modules.

## Goals of the Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
2. **Extensibility**: New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
3. **Maintainability**: Code is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify.
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other projects or in different parts of the same project.
5. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation.
6. **Performance**: The architecture is optimized for smooth gameplay with performance monitoring capabilities.
7. **Scalability**: Support for features like multiplayer and quality settings adjustments.

## Communication Between Components

Components communicate with each other primarily through the EventBus, which implements a publish-subscribe pattern. This allows components to remain decoupled while still being able to respond to events from other components.

### Key Event Flows:

1. **Input to Plane Movement**:
   - InputManager detects key presses
   - InputManager updates its internal state
   - Game requests input state during update
   - Game passes input state to Plane
   - Plane updates its movement based on input

2. **Plane State to UI**:
   - Plane updates its state (speed, altitude, etc.)
   - Plane emits events with updated state
   - UIManager listens for these events
   - UIManager updates UI components accordingly

3. **Audio Updates**:
   - Game passes plane state to AudioManager
   - AudioManager updates sound parameters based on plane state

4. **Weapons System**:
   - Input triggers weapon firing

5. **Enemy AI Behavior**:
   - Game provides player position to EnemyPlane
   - EnemyPlane determines appropriate AI state
   - EnemyPlane generates waypoints or pursues player
   - EnemyPlane fires weapons when conditions are met

6. **Multiplayer Synchronization**:
   - NetworkManager receives updates from server
   - NetworkManager updates remote player positions
   - NetworkManager sends local player updates to server
   - Remote firing events create bullets via AmmoSystem

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - PerformanceMonitor tracks metrics
   - QualitySettings adjusts detail levels as needed
   - SceneManager applies quality settings to scene elements

## Benefits of This Architecture
